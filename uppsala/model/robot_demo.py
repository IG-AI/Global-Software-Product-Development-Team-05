    A class which handles a LEGO robot. It can connect to a server and receive commands form the server.
    Methods
    -------
    connect(self):
        Connects the robot to the server.
    recv(self, command):
        Tries to receive a command form the server.
    start(self):
        Function that starts the robot in a new thread.
    stop(self):
        Function that stops the robot.
    turn_cardinal(self, direction):
        Turns the robot 90 degrees, either to left or right based on the input which should be left or right.
    run(self, speed=64):
        Starts the motors, with the speed as the input, as the default 64.
    start(self):
        Function that starts the robot in a new thread.
    brake(self):
        Stops the robots motors.
    disconnect(self)
        Disconnects the robot to the server.
